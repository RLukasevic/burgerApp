Clients side app which was made in NativeScript environment for android devices.

Used ES6 JavaScript, XML markup, CSS(very restricted version of it which NativeScript supports) as well as few packages for http requesting and some additional CSS features.

This was a great starting project(although it is not quite finished), doing which I got introduced to JavaScript classes, OOP, working with RESTful APIs and some styling tricks.

The file structure is kind of messy and for sure could be done better, but at some point I discovered the power of frameworks and decided to leave this project be for the greater time to finish it :)
